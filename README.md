# drogon_init

This is the drogon_init project.

## Owner's note (2023-08-12)

The overall project layout is generated by `cmake-init`, but we have observed that this is excessive for creating simple playgrounds based on third-party libraries. As a result, we are considering either abandoning this approach entirely or replacing the underlying layout with something more lightweight.
